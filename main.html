             <p>Hi there,</p><br>
             <p> Thanks for visting our page to keep in touch with us. It happens to the best of us – some users just do not want to receive your emails. That does not make them less valuable to your business, but you should respect their wishes. Besides, users who do subscribe will appreciate knowing that they can always opt out.</p><br>
         <p> If we look at the welcome message of Camelbak, a tourist and travel equipment manufacturer, we will find both the link to the company’s website and the Unsubscribe link at the very bottom. A clear Unsubscribe option helps to build trust with the customers, and Camelbak is a great example here</p>
